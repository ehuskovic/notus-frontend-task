# HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT? 
- I would suggest to clone the project, open with Visual Studio IDE for example and open on PORT 5500. 

# TECHNOLOGIES 
- I decided to do this project using HTML, JS and SCSS. I did one task with the help of JQuery. 

# TASK 
- the task was to make a website based on images made in Adobe XD and to do the same for smaller and mobile devices. 

# TASK 1 
- first task was to make a loader that will be visible everytime page is loading. For the testing purposes and showing purposes I intentionally put setTimer function on one second 
so you can see how it works for yourselves. I did some simple rotation to have an animation effect. 

# TASK 2
- for the second task I did a slider that has a static text. Everytime user clicks the button the image will change and the content will sty the same. 
- the logic for the slider is in slider.js file 

# TASK 3 
- the third task was a fixed gallery based on the image as everything above. I did it like on the picture and it is a little bit different on smaller devices
- for smaller devices I changed flex-direction based on my personal wishes. 

# TASK 4
- for this task I developed a slider gallery. On every click the pointer of the image changes. I did it with the help of jQuery. It is responsive on smaller and mobile devices as well. 

# TASK 5
- for this task I needed to do map, buuton and footer
- for map I payed a google billing otherwise it was not working properly, on hover button changes color
- everything is responsive

# TASK 6 
- for this task I needed to do a menu. 
- everythime user clicks a menu image and text of the menu changes and there is a navigation. 
- each click of navigation will lead you to the section where that task is
